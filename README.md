# DATA-ENCRYPTION-AND-DECRYPTION
The purpose of this section is to present how encryption and decryption can be used to implement security in the Web. It starts with a list of challenges for protecting information, continues with the presentation of the basic encryption decryption algorithms and protocols, presents the Secure Sockets Layer protocol, and concludes with an example of how cryptography is used in a commercial transaction on the Internet. From a technical point of view, cryptography is the solution to many of the security challenges that are present in the Internet. The technology exists to solve most of the problems. However, there are several issues that have obstructed the widespread use of cryptography in the Internet.
